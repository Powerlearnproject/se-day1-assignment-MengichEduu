#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
   # Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. It encompasses the processes, methods, and tools used to create software systems. Its importance lies in delivering high-quality software that meets user needs, is reliable, 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
# 1960s - Birth of software engineering
# 1970s - Intro of structured programming
# 1990 - Rise of agile


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    Planning
    Gathering Information 
    Design
    Implementation
    Testing
    Deployment
    Maintenance 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    Waterfall - Linear sequential
    Agile - Iterative and flexible mode


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    Software Developer: Designs, writes, and maintains code; collaborates with team members; fixes bugs.
    Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality through testing, developing test plans, and reporting issues.
    Project Manager: Oversees project execution, manages resources, timelines, and stakeholder communication.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide tools for coding, testing, and debugging (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse).
    Version Control Systems (VCS): Manage code changes and collaboration (e.g., Git, Subversion).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Challenges: Handling changing requirements, balancing technical debt, managing communication among teams.
    Strategies: Maintain clear documentation, implement iterative planning, and facilitate regular team meetings.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
        Unit Testing: Tests individual components for functionality.
        Integration Testing: Tests combined parts of an application for interaction.
        System Testing: Tests the complete system to ensure compliance with specified requirements.
        Acceptance Testing: Validates the software against user expectations and requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
        Prompt engineering is the design and refinement of prompts used to interact with AI models, ensuring they receive instructions in a way the model can understand. Its importance lies in maximizing the effectiveness of the responses generated by AI, leading to better output quality.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
        Vague Prompt: "Tell me about cars."
Improved Prompt: "Give me a brief overview of electric cars, including their benefits and challenges compared to traditional gasoline vehicles."
Explanation: The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear context, specifies the topic (electric cars), and outlines the information needed (benefits and challenges), leading to a focused and informative response.
